This project focuses on predicting housing prices using multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Robust Regression. The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing Dataset, a well-known dataset that contains various features of housing units in Boston, such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rates, among others.

### Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data exploration and visualization to understand the relationships between the features and target variable (MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes).
Data Preprocessing: Steps for data cleaning, feature selection, and feature scaling (standardization).
Model Building:
Linear Regression: The basic approach to model the relationship between the features and target variable.
Polynomial Regression: An advanced regression technique used to capture non-linear relationships.
Robust Regression (RANSAC): A model that helps in identifying and excluding outliers from the training data to improve model accuracy.
Performance Metrics: Evaluating model performance using key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.
Visualization: Data visualizations to show the regression line, scatter plots, and model performance.

### Tools and Technologies:
Python: Programming language used for all computations.
Scikit-learn: Library for implementing machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and RANSAC.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization and plotting.
